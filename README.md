# Genesis 39 Project

The Genesis 39 project provides firmware images for families and individuals
who want to protect themselves from pornography and other objectionable content
found on the internet.

This firmware forces all computers connected to your router to use OpenDNS's 
Family Shield Service. This ensures that every computer connected to your
router is protected **automatically**.

## OpenDNS Family Shield
FamilyShield blocks domains that are categorized as:
 - Tasteless
 - Proxy/Anonymizer
 - Sexuality and Pornography

## Supported Routers / WiFi Access Points
 - TP-LINK Archer C7
